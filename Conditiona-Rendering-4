//In React, there is no special syntax for writing conditions.
//Instead, you’ll use the same techniques as you use when writing regular JavaScript code.
//For example, you can use an if statement to conditionally include JSX:

let content;
if (isLoggedIn) {
  content = <AdminPanel />;
} else {
  content = <LoginForm />;
}
return (
  <div>
    {content}
  </div>
);
// More complex than above

<div>
  {isLoggedIn ? (
    <AdminPanel />
  ) : (
    <LoginForm />
  )}
</div>

//When I don’t need the else branch, you can also use a shorter logical && syntax:

<div>
  {isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />}
</div>

// All of these approaches also work for conditionally specifying attributes. 
//If you’re unfamiliar with some of this JavaScript syntax, you can start by always using if...else.
